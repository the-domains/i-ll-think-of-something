Making up stories in my brain

Stories come to me. I find them lying around in my brain, waiting for a few thoughts to string them together with words. 

Finding the words to tell the story, seeking the structure to build suspense, infusing meaning between the lines, pulling together long narratives from ideas. This is the art of storytelling.

Stories of the future, stories of far away places, stories of travel in time. Connections between people, between people and the places they inhabit. way that circumstances, choices, motivations and events change the future. All these things make a story of people in a world, built by me, from my peculiar perspective, shared with you to challenge yours.

I write science fiction.
