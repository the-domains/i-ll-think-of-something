Speaking of the future ...

"The future is already here, it is just not evenly distributed." William Gibson.

The future finds its way into our lives. It seeps, and brings dread or fear. It floats, anticipation causing us to breath deeply with delight. It engages us in thought: "what if" -  "should we" - "let's see".

The future is ours. It belongs to everyone of us. It is a destination that we all arrive at, willingly or not.

The future changes us.

It is at once exciting and terrifying. It is to be embraced and it is to be resisted. 

Let's see if we can change the future together.
